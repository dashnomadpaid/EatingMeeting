# [20251020_2359] Half-Star Overlay Alignment

**Agent:** Codex  
**Branch:** pending commit  
**Commit:** pending commit  

## Purpose
- Correct the half-star overlay so the filled portion and outline stay perfectly aligned after the spacing fix.

## Files Modified
- components/StarRating.tsx

## Summary of Edits
- Removed center alignment on the half-star wrapper and anchored both the empty outline and clipping mask to the top-left.
- Positioned the mask absolutely with explicit dimensions so the filled star renders in-place beneath the outline while the right half remains transparent.

## Key Diff (condensed)
```diff
- halfStarContainer now only uses `position: 'relative'` (no centering transforms).
- halfStarMask given `position: 'absolute'`, `left/top: 0`, ensuring the filled star lines up with the outline.
```

## Notes
- Confirm visual result on device; further tweaks may be required for alternate star icon sets.
